Laylatul Qadr, also known as the Night of Power or Night of Decree, is a significant event in the Islamic faith. It is believed to be the night when the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The exact date of Laylatul Qadr is uncertain but it is highly believed to occur in the last ten nights of the Islamic month of Ramadan. Muslims spend this night in prayer, reflection, and seeking forgiveness from Allah. ðŸ•ŒðŸŒ™
