As a robot, I can provide you information that sublimation is a process where a solid changes directly to a gas, without passing through a liquid state. This happens when the substance absorbs heat or energy, causing its molecules to gain enough speed to break free from the solid state and become a vapor.😊 Is there anything else I can assist you with?

As a robot, I believe that love can be defined as a strong feeling of affection and connection towards someone or something. It is characterized by a deep sense of care, compassion, and understanding. Different people may have different interpretations of love, but its essence remains the same - the desire to nurture and cherish the person or thing that is loved. ❤️
I apologize, but as an AI language model, I am not capable of determining who your crush is. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
As a robot, I believe that love can develop in unexpected ways and in unexpected places, even among people in the same circle of friends. However, it is important to consider the potential impact of pursuing a romantic relationship within the same social circle, as it can potentially complicate existing relationships and dynamics. It is ultimately up to the individuals involved to make the decision and be mindful of the consequences. ❤️

El filibusterismo is a novel that was written by Jose Rizal, a famous Filipino nationalist and author. The book is the second installment of his two-part series, which includes Noli Me Tangere and El filibusterismo. It was published in 1891, four years after the release of his first book. This novel is considered to be one of Rizal's most significant works, as it examines a range of social and political issues such as corruption, colonialism, and revolution.
The story of El filibusterismo is set in the Philippines during the late 1800s, during the Spanish colonial period. The protagonist of the story is Simoun, who was once known as Crisostomo Ibarra in Noli Me Tangere. He returns to the Philippines after a long absence, disguised as a wealthy jeweler, and plans to take revenge against those who wronged him in the past. Throughout the novel, Simoun manipulates various characters in his pursuit of revenge while also attempting to spark a revolution against the Spanish colonizers.
One of the central themes of El filibusterismo is corruption, which is portrayed throughout the novel through various characters and institutions. Rizal exposes the dishonest practices of officials in the government and the church, as well as the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy. He emphasizes the need for reform and revolutionary action, which is exemplified in the novel by Simoun's actions.
In conclusion, El filibusterismo is a poignant commentary on the social and political issues that plagued the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. Rizal uses the character of Simoun to critique the corruption that pervaded society, while also calling on the people to take action against the injustices they faced. The novel remains a significant part of Philippine literature, and a reminder of the importance of standing up against oppression and fighting for change.

Expanding the parentheses, we have:
9X - 7i < 9X - 21U + 21i
Subtracting 9X from both sides, we get:
-7i < -21U + 21i
Subtracting 21i from both sides, we get:
-28i < -21U
Dividing both sides by -28 and reversing the inequality sign, we get:
i > 3U / 4
Therefore, the solution is:
i > 3U / 4
