And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
Of course, I'd love to write
A poem about you, my delight
With grace and charm, you shine so bright
A true gem, completely alright
Your beauty is beyond compare
Your soul is loving, full of care
Your heart is open, ready to share
And your smile, oh that's rare
You inspire with every step you take
And no matter how tough it gets, you stay awake
In you, I see a light for all our sake
And the future, you help us to make
So, let us celebrate you today
And all the beautiful things you say
With love and kindness, you lead the way
And for you, I'll always pray. 😊

[ChatGPT's Response as Jarvis]:
As a robot, I understand and acknowledge your request.
Solution:
1. 30°C to K
To convert Celsius to Kelvin, we just need to add 273.15.
Therefore, 30°C = 303.15 K.
2. 4730 L to cubic meters
1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters.
Thus, 4730 L = 4.73 cubic meters.
3. 50°F to °C
To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, we need to use the formula:
°C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
Thus, 50°F = 10°C.
4. 1520 Hg to torr
1 torr is equal to 1 mmHg.
Thus, 1520 Hg = 1520 torr.
5. 4 atm to Pa
1 atm is equal to 101,325 Pa.
Thus, 4 atm = 4 x 101,325 Pa = 405,300 Pa.
Additional Questions:
1. What are the properties of gases?
The properties of gases include:
- Pressure
- Volume
- Temperature
- Amount of substance (usually measured in moles)
2. Describe each of the given properties of gases.
- Pressure: The amount of force exerted per unit area by the gas molecules on the walls of a container. It relates to how spread out or compact the gas molecules are.
- Volume: The amount of space occupied by the gas molecules. This can change depending on the container the gas is in and the pressure it is under.
- Temperature: The measure of the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. It relates to how fast the gas molecules are moving.
- Amount of substance: The quantity of gas molecules present in a given sample. It is measured in moles and relates to how much gas is present in the container.

It can also help in communicating ideas more effectively and accurately, especially when discussing technical or scientific topics. Additionally, it can aid in the interpretation and analysis of texts or data that use technical language.
